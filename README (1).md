# COLLABCANVAS (Collaborative Drawing Application )

A robust desktop web application designed for canvas-based digital drawing. Users can create and manipulate artwork using a diverse range of tools such as freehand sketches, lines, rectangles, and text. The application provides extensive customization options, making it a powerful tool for creative expression.


## Overview

This application offers an intuitive drawing interface with a variety of features, including:

ðŸ‘‰ **Freehand Drawing:** Allows unrestricted sketching directly on the canvas.

ðŸ‘‰ **Shape Drawing:** Enables the creation of lines and rectangles, with options for resizing.

ðŸ‘‰ **Text Input:** Facilitates the addition and precise positioning of text elements.

ðŸ‘‰ **Tool Customization:** Offers flexibility in adjusting tool settings like color, roughness, size, and stroke width.

ðŸ‘‰ **Eraser Tool:** Easily erase any unwanted parts of your drawing.

ðŸ‘‰ **Clear All:** Provides a quick way to clear the entire canvas.

ðŸ‘‰ **Undo/Redo:** Supports undoing and redoing actions for error correction.
## Known Constraints

ðŸ‘‰ **Rectangle Deletion:** Currently, deleting elements within rectangles removes the rectangle first, followed by the enclosed content. It is advisable to move the rectangle before attempting deletion. A fix for this issue is planned in a future update.

ðŸ‘‰ **Text Tool Focus:** There are focus issues with the text tool, which will be addressed in an upcoming release.
